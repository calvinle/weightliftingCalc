This project's goal is to calculate what Kilogram discs to load onto a barbell, given a valid input (also in kilograms).
For example, say a person wants to do a lift at 150KG. Excluding the barbell (20KG) and combined collars weight (5KG),
the remaining weight must equal 125KG. On each side of the barbell, there should be
*2 * 25KG Discs (Red)
*1 * 10KG Disc (Green)
*1 * 2.5KG Disc (Black)
